# Data Structure Visualizer

This project provides an interactive data structure visualizer built with **Streamlit**. It allows users to explore various data structures such as Stack, Queue, ChainMap, Deque, Priority Queue, Binary Tree, Graph, Linked List, and Heap with easy-to-use visualizations. The app leverages Python libraries like **Matplotlib**, **NetworkX**, and **Heapq** to present visual representations of these data structures.

## Features

- **Stack**: Visualize push and pop operations with the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
- **Queue**: Explore enqueue and dequeue operations with the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
- **ChainMap**: View how multiple dictionaries can be combined and managed using `ChainMap`.
- **Deque**: Interact with a double-ended queue, enabling insertion and deletion from both ends.
- **Priority Queue**: Visualize insertion and removal of elements with associated priorities.
- **Binary Tree**: Build and visualize a simple binary tree structure.
- **Graph**: Visualize an undirected graph with user-defined edges.
- **Linked List**: Perform insertions and deletions on a linked list.
- **Heap**: Interact with a heap, inserting elements and removing the minimum.

## Installation
